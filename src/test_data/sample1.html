<b><i><u>High-Level Design Insights:</u></i></b>

1.  <b>Efficient Room Assignment</b>: The use of two priority queues (<code>vacant_rooms</code> and <code>end_timestamps</code>) ensures that assigning rooms and releasing rooms is done in logarithmic time. This guarantees that each room assignment and availability update operates efficiently while preserving the priority of earlier-finished rooms.
2.  <b>Controlling Room Load</b>: <code>BinaryHeap</code> operations ensure that the solution optimizes the assignment by always preferring rooms that either finish next or are numerically smallest, which is essential both for minimizing room idle time and ensuring that ties are broken by room index.
3.  <b>Synchronization Between Events</b>: The while-loop releasing rooms prior to every new meeting safeguards against booking conflicts—this ensures that rooms that have finished their meetings by the current meeting&#39;s start are available to be reassigned.
4.  <b>Use of <code>unreachable_unchecked</code> as a Fallback</b>: The use of this unsafe hint significantly improves runtime performance by signaling to the compiler that no fallback logic is required here, as the problem constraints guarantee the existence of valid rooms/future availability.
